INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------
It is highly recommended that you perform a global install of django-eve-proxy
in your Python's site-packages directory. The easiest way to do this is to
change to the django-eve-proxy directory and type one of the following
commands, depending on your operating system.

WINDOWS
-------
Make sure you are logged in as an administrator, open a console, cd to the
django-eve-proxy directory, and run:

    python setup.py install
    
LINUX/UNIX/MAC
--------------
Make sure you have sudo or root access. Depending on whether you have sudo
or root, either include or exclude the sudo part of the command string
below:

    sudo python setup.py install
    
WHAT DOES THIS DO?
------------------
setup.py is a script that does many things, one of which is install Python
packages such as django-eve-proxy. It puts all of the files where they belong
and makes whatever you're installing globally available to all Python
instances.

WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE ADMINISTRATIVE ACCESS?
-------------------------------------------
You may move the eve_proxy directory to somewhere in your Python path (the
easiest thing is to just toss the directory inside your Django project
somewhere) and add it to INSTALLED_APPS as normal, taking any different paths
into account (for example, if you move eve_proxy to myproject/apps/, you
may need to add 'apps.eve_proxy' to INSTALLED_APPS instead of 'eve_proxy')
